And just a question for the RPC updates, RPC function updates you did. Did you take into account all the migrations we did? Because in the function folder within the Suppabase folder, RPC folder within the Suppabase folder, we only have the functions but we did a bunch of migrations. So did you take that into account? That's question number one. And question number two, did you deploy all the edge functions and should I now deploy the RPC functions manually or how do we work?
