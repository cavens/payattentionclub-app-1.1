## Phase 3: Multiple Concurrent Syncs Issue

**Status**: Known Issue - Non-Critical  
**Severity**: Medium (Performance/Cost)  
**Date Identified**: 2025-11-28  
**Phase**: Phase 3 - Sync Manager Implementation

### Description

Multiple concurrent calls to `syncDailyUsage()` are executing simultaneously instead of being serialized. When `syncToBackend()` is called multiple times (e.g., from app launch, foreground, and multiple views), 3-5 sync operations run concurrently, all syncing the same data.

### Symptoms

- Multiple sync operations complete for the same entries
- All syncs share the same call ID (suspicious - should be unique UUIDs)
- Logs show multiple "✅ Successfully synced" messages for the same data
- Both `UsageSyncManager` coordinator and `BackendClient` guards are not preventing concurrent execution

### Impact

**Functional**: ✅ None - Syncs complete successfully, data reaches backend, entries marked as synced  
**Performance**: ⚠️ Medium - 3-5x more network requests and database writes than necessary  
**Cost**: ⚠️ Medium - More Supabase RPC calls = higher costs at scale  
**User Experience**: ✅ None - Happens in background, users don't notice  
**Data Integrity**: ✅ None - Backend appears idempotent, no data corruption observed

### Root Cause Analysis

**Attempted Solutions**:
1. ✅ `UsageSyncManager` uses `SyncCoordinator` with serial `DispatchQueue` - **Partially working** (allows 6 concurrent calls through)
2. ❌ `BackendClient` guard using `withCheckedContinuation` + async queue - Race condition, multiple calls get through
3. ❌ Attempted `NSLock` - Cannot use in async context (Swift 6)
4. ❌ Changed to `sync` dispatch for atomic check-and-set - **Still not working** (6 calls all see `isSyncing: false` simultaneously)

**Current Implementation**:
- `UsageSyncManager` coordinator: Uses serial `DispatchQueue` with `withCheckedContinuation` - **Partially working** (allows 6 concurrent calls)
- `BackendClient` guard: Uses `sync` dispatch on serial queue for atomic check-and-set - **Not working** (6 calls all see `isSyncing: false` simultaneously)

**Latest Test Results (2025-11-28 23:36)**:
- 6 concurrent `syncToBackend()` calls all got `canStart=true` from coordinator
- All 6 calls share same call ID `6EE719D9` (should be unique)
- All 6 calls see `isSyncing: false` in BackendClient guard simultaneously
- All 6 syncs complete successfully
- Root cause: Both guards failing - coordinator allows 6 through, BackendClient allows all 6 through

**Suspected Issue**:
- Race condition where multiple continuations are created before queue processes them
- All syncs getting same call ID suggests they might be from same execution context
- Missing initial logs (`🔵 syncDailyUsage() called`) suggests buffering/filtering issue

### Code Locations

- `UsageSyncManager.swift`: `syncToBackend()` method, `SyncCoordinator` class
- `BackendClient.swift`: `syncDailyUsage()` method, static `_isSyncingDailyUsage` flag and `_syncQueue`

### When to Fix

**Priority**: Medium  
**Suggested Timeline**: After Phase 4+ implementation, or when:
- Costs become an issue
- Performance degrades noticeably
- Data inconsistencies appear
- Dedicated optimization time available

### Proposed Fix

**Root Cause Analysis Needed**:
- Why does `sync` dispatch allow multiple calls to see `isSyncing: false` simultaneously?
- Why do all calls share the same call ID? (UUID generation issue?)
- Why does coordinator allow 6 calls through instead of 1?

**Potential Solutions**:
1. **Use Swift `actor`** for both `UsageSyncManager` and `BackendClient` sync coordination (async-safe)
2. **Single global sync coordinator** - Remove duplicate guards, use one authoritative coordinator
3. **OSAllocatedUnfairLock** - Modern Swift concurrency primitive (iOS 16+)
4. **Semaphore-based approach** - Use `DispatchSemaphore` for serialization
5. **Investigate call ID issue** - Why are UUIDs not unique? Could indicate deeper problem

**Recommended Approach**: Use Swift `actor` - designed for this exact use case (async-safe state management)

### Testing

To verify fix:
1. Trigger multiple sync calls simultaneously (app launch + foreground + manual)
2. Check logs for:
   - Only ONE sync operation completing
   - Other calls being rejected or queued
   - Unique call IDs for each attempt
3. Verify backend receives only one sync request per entry
